About This Resort

The Poovath Heritage, Fort Kochi
Relive the glorious past at The Poovath Heritage, a renovated colonial building from the colonial era. It stands by
bewitching Arabian Sea in Fort Kochi on the south west coast of India. Fort Kochi also known as ‘Queen of the Arabian
Sea’ is a laid back coastal town with a colonial past.

Vestiges of Portugese, Dutch, and British (in that order) colonialism lie scattered apart from the religious influences
like synagogues, churches and so on. But long before them, the Arabs and the Chinese and even the Greeks traded with
Kochi. So, it is aptly said to be the cultural crossroads. For those with a penchant for history, Poovath and the
surroundings will have much to say.

The in-house restaurant brings the Cuisines of the World to one table. Relish delicacies as varied as North Indian,
South Indian, Continental, Italian and more. Done to perfection by experienced cooks, the authentic recipes
of the different regions.

Enjoy a dip in the private pool while the breeze from the Arabian Sea caresses you.
